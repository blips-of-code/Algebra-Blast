Mathematics game for 6th-7th graders teaching them basic algebra. 

Description:
Algebra Blast is a retro, space‑themed mathematics game designed for 6th–7th grade students learning introductory algebra. Inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invaders, the player controls a small drone positioned at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down the alien displaying the correct solution to a simple algebraic equation shown at the top. Each alien carries a possible answer, and only one is correct. Players earn points for accuracy (4 points per), lose points and a life for incorrect shots (2 points per), and must prevent the aliens from reaching them. Their score gets tallied up in the score indicator at the top right of the screen. Correct hits award points and break the alien into pixel fragments. One wrong shot is a life and players have 3 lives.  The game gradually increases in difficulty by speeding up enemy movement and adding more answer choices/aliens as the player progresses. They start off with 3 aliens in round 1 (1 correct answer, 2 wrong answers) and then it becomes 4 in round 2 (1 correct answer, 3 wrong answers).  When the player dies, the game informs them GAME OVER
The game will start with a Star Wars style text introduction where a scroll of text welcomes the user “A long time ago in a galaxy far far away…”. The whole game is in a retro pixelated space style.  Then it will reveal the title screen Algebra Blast and there will be a pixelated play button below the title. Once the player hits play the screen with the drone on players side in the bottom middle of their screen with projectiles aiming intially at the middle alien, appears. From there, the player can see a simple algebra formula asking to solve for x such as x + 3 = 6 at the top of their screen and they can use their left and right arrow keys or the mouse/trackpad to move their missile left and right to shoot down the alien with the correct answer. Which in this case, is 3. They need 4 circle bullets to hit the alien with 3 on it before it breaks and shatters into pixelated fragments and then they get moved to Round 2. Algebra Blast aims to reinforce algebraic reasoning through fast‑paced, interactive gameplay that feels more like an arcade challenge than a math drill.
For development, the creation environment used was GameMaker, a beginner‑friendly environment ideal for 2D arcade‑style games. GameMaker’s drag‑and‑drop interface and built‑in sprite, collision, and movement tools made it well‑suited for producing a functional one round prototype within the project timeline.
